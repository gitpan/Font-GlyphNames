Revision history for Font::GlyphNames

.03  29 May, 2008
     This is now a beta release. Changes are as follows:
     • You can now import all functions with the :all tag.
     • The constructor for the OO interface now accepts hashref syn-
       tax, allowing one to
       • customise the ‘reject’ character output by name2str and
       • have custom glyph lists searched for in @INC.
     • name2str in scalar context now concatenates the list of charac-
       ters/strings,  if there is more than one (instead of returning
       the last one, which was not particularly useful).
     • name2ord, str2name, ord2name and ord2ligname have been added.
     • name2str now correctly validates uXXXXX glyph names.
     • name2str now correctly validates hex digits (it used to allow
       Thai, Tamil, etc.)
     • COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 has been added to Makefile.PL as a fix for
       RT #35604 (resource forks). Thanks to Slaven Rezić for report-
       ing this).

.02  1 January, 2007
     Pre-alpha version. Only the name2str function has been imple-
     mented. It has a very minor bug.

.01  31 December, 2006
     I forgot to include a MANIFEST file, and then ran 'make dist' and
     uploaded an empty file to CPAN! Duh!
