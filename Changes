Revision history for Font::GlyphNames

.01  31 December, 2006
     I forgot to include a MANIFEST file, and then ran 'make dist' and
     uploaded an empty file to CPAN! Duh!

.02  1 January, 2007
     Pre-alpha version. Only the name2str function has been imple-
     mented. It has a very minor bug.
